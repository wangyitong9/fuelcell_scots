A path planning problem for a vehicle using the bycicle model

1. compile the vehicle.cc file

  a) edit the Makefile and adjust the CUDDPATH to the location where the cudd library is installed.

  b) you should be able to compile the program simply by

  $ make

2. execute 

  $./vehicle

  which produces

  ./vehicle_ss.bdd
  ./vehicle_obst.bdd
  ./vehicle_target.bdd
  ./vehicle_controller.bdd

3. simulate the closed loop in Matlab 

  a) you need to compile the mexfile first (see the readme in $(SCOTSROOT)/mfiles/mexfiles )

  b) in Matlab add the path and run the simulation 

   >> addpath(genpath('../../../mfiles'))
   >> vehicle
