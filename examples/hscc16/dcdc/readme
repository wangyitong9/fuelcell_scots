Controller synthesis for a DC DC boost converter to enforce a safety
specification


1. compile the dcdc.cc file

  a) edit the Makefile and adjust the CUDDPATH to the location where the cudd library is installed.

  b) now you should be able to compile the program simply by

    $ make

2. execute 

  $./dcdc

  which produces

  ./dcdc_controller.bdd

3. simulate the closed loop in Matlab 

  a) you need to compile the mexfile first (see the readme in $(SCOTSROOT)/mfiles/mexfiles )

  b) in Matlab add the path and run the simulation 

   >> addpath(genpath('../../../mfiles'))
   >> dcdc

4. if you want to compare with Pessoa

  a) in matlab 

    >> add the path to pessoa 
    >> dcdc_pessoa
