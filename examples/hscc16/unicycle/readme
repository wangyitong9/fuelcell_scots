A path planning problem for a unicycle 

1. compile the unicycle.cc file

  a) edit the Makefile and adjust the CUDDPATH to the location where the cudd library is installed.

  b) you should be able to compile the program simply by

  $ make

2. execute 

  $./unicycle

  which produces

  ./unicycle_ss.bdd
  ./unicycle_obst.bdd
  ./unicycle_target.bdd
  ./unicycle_controller.bdd

3. simulate the closed loop in Matlab 

  a) you need to compile the mexfile first (see the readme in $(SCOTSROOT)/mfiles/mexfiles )

  b) in Matlab add the path and run the simulation 

   >> addpath(genpath('../../../mfiles'))
   >> unicycle
