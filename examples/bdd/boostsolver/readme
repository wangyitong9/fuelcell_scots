Computation of a symbolic model using an ode solver provided by the Boost C++ library.

0. You need to have the Boost C++ library installed (www.boost.org)

1. compile the dcdc.cc file

  a) edit the Makefile and adjust the CUDDPATH to the location where the cudd library is installed.

  b) edit the Makefile and adjust the BOOSTINC to the location where the boost library is installed.

  b) now you should be able to compile the program simply by

    $ make

2. execute 

  $./dcdc
